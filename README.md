A high performance direct drive simwheel using openffb, odrive, and a ninebot g30 motor. 
Designed to possibly deliver over 35NM of peak torque, it upcycles an incredibly powerful electric scooter motor for high torque. Leveraging the high power of the ODESC 4.2 56V, and a 1200W 48V PSU, along with a reduction and encoder position tracking of over 12582912 discreete locations, It's a no-compromises design that is both budget friendly and capable of competing with simwheels in the thousands of dollars in terms of resolution and power. 
It is designed to be mainly 3d-printable, clamp to desks, modular, and fit the standard 6x70mm steering wheel lug.
